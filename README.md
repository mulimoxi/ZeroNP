#  ZeroNP README
## Basic Introduction
This is C implementation of SOLNP algorithm(Original name:SOLNP_PLUS), which is proposed by Yinyu Ye (1989) and originally implemented in Matlab. Various improvements have been made to increase the robustness and reduce number of function evaluations compared with the original version. 
    
ZeroNP solves the general derivative-free nonlinear constrained problems of the form:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \min\_x\ &f(x) \\ 
    \text{s.t.} \ & g(x) = 0, \\
                  & l\_h\leq h(x)\leq u\_h, \\
                  & l\_x \leq x \leq u\_x,
\end{aligned}
$$

where $f(x),g(x),h(x)$ are smooth functions.
## Getting Started
Currently, ZeroNP only provides Matlab interface. The user can learn the details of installing and using in `ZERONP USER GUIDE.html`. The user can choose OSQP solver to solve the QP subproblem.
